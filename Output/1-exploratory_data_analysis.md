# Initial descriptive statistics and visualizations

In this document you will find the steps required to perform an initial exploration analysis of the traffic & climate data combined in [../R/1-import.R](`R/1-import.R`).

## Load packages

To conduct this analysis we need a few packages loaded in the R environment. `pacman` Is 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
