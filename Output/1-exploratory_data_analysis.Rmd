# Initial descriptive statistics and visualizations

In this document you will find the steps required to perform an initial exploration analysis of the traffic & climate data combined in [`R/1-import.R`](../R/1-import.R).

## Load packages

To conduct this analysis we need a few packages loaded in the R environment. `pacman` is used for convenience as it will install (and if required easily update) required packages when not installed. If you prefer you could run `install.packages("packagename")` and `library("packagename")` instead.

```{r loadpackages, echo=TRUE}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```
